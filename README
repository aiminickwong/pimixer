pimixer Information
=======================

This package contains a modified version of the xfce4-mixer volume control 
application based on GStreamer 0.10 originally written to conceptually fit 
into the Xfce desktop environment. It also contains a plugin for the Xfce 
panel which is especially designed for use with the mouse wheel.

The application has been modified for use with Raspberry Pi by removing the Xfce
look and feel and adding a control to select the default audio output on Pi.

Known Problems with GStreamer
-----------------------------

  * No sound card detected: if this happens you're probably missing a
    GStreamer plugin for your sound system. If you get this message on a
    Debian or Ubuntu system and you're using ALSA then installing 
    gstreamer0.10-alsa should fix it. On OpenBSD installing 
    gst-plugins-good might help.
